Excellent article. Only one thing. Regarding the question "Boom! Visual Studio, why are yous till 32-bit". I have read the answer in Rico Mariani's blog. Haven't found the original post that I read, but this is good enough: https://www.infoq.com/news/2016/01/VS-64-bit

Thanks for the link! My point was more of how "Virtual Size" in Process Explorer can detect a 32-bit process.
